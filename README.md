## Overview

SchizoTerminalAI is an experimental terminal interface that reimagines how we interact with command-line environments. By incorporating elements of natural language processing and unconventional data presentation, it creates a unique computing experience that challenges users to think differently about human-computer interaction.

## Features

- **Dynamic Response Patterns**: The terminal's outputs follow non-linear patterns, creating unexpected but meaningful connections between commands and responses.
- **Multi-threaded Conversations**: Enables parallel command processing streams that intersect and interact with each other in novel ways.
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Identifies and highlights hidden patterns in command history and system outputs.
- **Reality Augmentation**: Overlays additional context and alternative interpretations onto standard terminal operations.
- **Temporal Shifting**: Commands and outputs may appear to occur in non-chronological order, creating unique causality chains.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/schizoterminalai.git
cd schizoterminalai
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NLTK
- OpenAI GPT-3 API (optional)
- Tensorflow 2.4+

## Quick Start

1. Launch the terminal:
```bash
schizo-terminal
```

2. Begin with basic commands:
```bash
> explore
> interpret <filename>
> connect-threads
```

3. Experience the system's unique responses and follow the emerging patterns.

## Advanced Usage

### Pattern Recognition

```bash
> analyze-patterns --depth=3
> thread-connect alpha beta
> temporal-shift --window=10m
```

### Reality Augmentation

```bash
